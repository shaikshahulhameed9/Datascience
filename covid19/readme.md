🌍 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

📌 Overview
This project explores the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic impact and global happiness indicators using real-world datasets.
By combining the COVID-19 confirmed and deaths data with the World Happiness Report, the goal is to uncover trends and correlations across countries.

⚙️ Steps Performed
Loaded and cleaned the datasets using pandas
Aggregated COVID-19 data by country
Merged it with the Happiness dataset
Visualized patterns and correlations using matplotlib and seaborn
Derived insights on how GDP, life expectancy, and happiness scores relate to pandemic outcomes

🧮 Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

📊 Key Insights
Higher GDP per capita and life expectancy correlated with fewer deaths.
Countries ranking higher in happiness generally experienced better control and recovery.
Demonstrated practical use of data cleaning, merging, and visualization in real-world analysis.
