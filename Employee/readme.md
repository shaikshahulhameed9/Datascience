# Employee Performance & Retention Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes employee performance and predicts attrition using classical ML and simple deep learning models. It includes EDA, probability/statistical analysis, classification for attrition, regression for performance, and Keras-based models.

## Files
- `employee_analysis.py` — main script (run it to produce plots and models).
- `employee_data.csv` — your dataset (place in the same folder or update the path in the script).
- `output/` — produced by the script; contains plots and saved models.

## How to run
1. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
