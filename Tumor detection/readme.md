## Overview
This project classifies tumors as malignant or benign using Random Forest. The notebook includes data cleaning, EDA, preprocessing (scaling & encoding), model training, evaluation (accuracy, ROC AUC, confusion matrix), and visualization of feature importances.

## How to run
1. Place `Tumor_Detection.csv` in `data/` or update path in the notebook.
2. Create virtual env and install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run `notebooks/Tumor_Detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

## Key Results
- Add your final model metrics here after running the notebook (accuracy, ROC AUC, observations).
