**Author:** Shahul Hameed Shaik  
**Course:** Module 13 — Project: Rainfall Prediction  
**Dataset:** Austin Weather (`austin_weather.csv`)

## Project Overview
This project predicts daily precipitation (in inches) using historical weather data recorded in Austin, Texas. The main goals are:
- preprocess and clean the dataset,
- train a Linear Regression model to predict `PrecipitationSumInches`,
- analyze relationships between precipitation and other weather attributes (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.),
- visualize trends and evaluate model performance.
