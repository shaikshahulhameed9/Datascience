Neural Network for Image Recognition
This project demonstrates a simple Neural Network built from scratch using NumPy that learns to recognize binary image patterns representing the letters A, B, and C.

🧠 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand the core concepts of neural networks without relying on deep learning frameworks.
All computations — including weight initialization, forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent — are implemented manually using NumPy.

⚙️ Features
Fully manual implementation of a feedforward neural network
Binary pattern recognition for letters A, B, and C

Custom functions for:
Forward and backward passes
Sigmoid activation
Error calculation and weight updates
Visualization of the network’s learning progress

📊 Technologies Used
Python 3
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuralNetwork-ImageRecognition.git
cd NeuralNetwork-ImageRecognition

Run the notebook
jupyter notebook program.ipynb
Observe the training process and pattern recognition results.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Gained practical understanding of how neural networks learn and adjust weights
Built intuition on gradient descent and error minimization
Strengthened foundations in data preprocessing and matrix operations

💡 Future Enhancements
Extend the model to recognize more characters
Experiment with deeper architectures or different activation functions
Integrate visualization tools to show neuron activations
